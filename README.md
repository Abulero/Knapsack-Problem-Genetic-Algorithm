# Knapsack-Problem-Genetic-Algorithm
Solving the knapsack problem using a genetic algorithm made in python3, allowing for the code to be used as a simple genetic algorithm playground.

# Knapsack Problem
See:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem

# How does the playground work?
You can tinker with the following parameters:

Population size
Number of generations
Mutation
Crossover

# Population size and number of generations
Population size and the number of generations with both (each in their own way) increase the number of gene exchanges, mutations and overall computational time required for the simulation to end. It is imperative for these numbers to be high enough for the population to reach optimal fitness.

# Mutation
Mutation is one of the most importante aspects of the genetic algorithm. Without it, the population may lean towards a local peak of fitness, instead of the global one.
